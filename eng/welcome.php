      <p><strong>Dear Friends,</strong></p>
      <p>I  take particular pleasure in welcoming you to the Fourth Mykola Lysenko  International Music Competition in the year  of the celebrations of the 170th anniversary of the great Master.</p>
      <p>Lysenko  - the patriarch and founder of the Ukrainian composition school - by his  historic significance stands alongside such powerful figures of Ukrainian  culture as Taras Shevchenko, Ivan Franko, Lesia Ukrainka and Ivan Kotliarevsky.</p>
      <p>His  work constitutes a very important part of Ukrainian culture and there are many  exemplary followers of the Grand Master taking his music to the future  generations.</p>
      <p>The  contest, named after Mykola Lysenko, is not only a creative competition, but  also a huge exchange of experience from musicians of different generations,  schools and countries.</p>
      <p>Since  its inception, the Competition has inspired artists to achieve and to win,  contributed to their professional development, and also brought profound  emotions and unforgettable memories to the numerous music aficionados.</p>
      <p>I  am deeply convinced that the highly competent jury will determine the most  decent performers in the piano, violin, violoncello and vocal categories that  will be included in the history of the 21st century.</p>
      <p>Wishing  you wholeheartedly a lot of strength, happiness, success and inspiration for  the new achievements.</p>
      <p><strong>Yours  sincerely,<br />
        Mykhaylo  Kulyniak</strong></p>
      <strong>Minister of Culture of Ukraine</strong>
      <p><br /></p>
